# ProjectName audit

Lake's lint driver. Each subcommand prints its findings and exits nonzero if
there are any:

* `self-test`: proves every source and environment rule fires on modules that
  break it, and that none fires on compliant ones.
* `format`: text rules for every owned `.lean` file.
* `source`: ownership and syntax rules for every owned `.lean` file. The build
  runs it before compiling any owned module, so no banned command can run first.
* `manifest`: toolchain and dependency pinning.
* `environment`: kernel, axiom, contract, documentation, linter, and IR rules for
  the specifications, library, and executable.
* `test-environment`: the same rules for the test harness, which defines its own
  `main` and so needs its own environment.

Helpers for `scripts/check.sh` and the self-test print what they compute instead:

* `dependency-imports`: the dependency modules owned files import, which must be
  built before `source` can parse with their syntax.
* `library-declarations` and `executable-declarations`: the written
  declarations of that role, for the external kernel checker. The library's
  include its specifications.
* `self-test-case`: the findings for one self-test case.

Without a subcommand, every check except `source` runs, each in its own process:
importing an environment with extensions can be done once per process.
